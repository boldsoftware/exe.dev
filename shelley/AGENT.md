1. Never add sleeps to tests.
2. Brevity, brevity, brevity! Do not do weird defaults; have only one way of doing things; refactor relentlessly as necessary.
3. If something doesn't work, propagate the error or exit or crash. Do not have "fallbacks".
4. Do not keep old methods around for "compatibility"; this is a new project and there
   are no compatibility concerns yet.
5. The "predictable" model is a test fixture that lets you specify what a model would say if you said
   a thing. This is useful for interactive testing with a browser, since you don't rely on a model,
   and can fabricate some inputs and outputs. To test things, launch shelley with the relevant flag
   to only expose this model, and use shelley with a browser.
